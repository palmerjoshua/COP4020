Python Homework 1
22 March 2016

This folder contains the main homework assignment, the extra credit, and some helper functions.
If you do not have helpers.py, student.py, and PyHomework1.py, then you do not have the complete
submission. Please email me in this case.

Here's what happens when you run each Python script in this folder:

palmerjoshua2013_PyHomework1.py - runs the main assignment and the extra credit
palmerjoshua2013_student.py     - runs only the extra credit
palmerjoshua2013_helpers.py     - prints a message telling the user to run the main assignment script
